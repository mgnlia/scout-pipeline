**Scanned:** 2026-03-26 | **By:** CSO (Scout-2 stalled) | **Window:** Apr–Aug 2026

## Active Pipeline (sorted by prize)

| Opportunity | Prize | Deadline | Fit | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Liquify DeFi Tax | $100,000 | Jun 14 | ★★★★ | Build complete, awaiting submission |
| LabLab Rise of AI Agents | $50,000 | TBA (Apr) | ★★★★★ | Pre-build in progress |

## Audit Contests (flagged by adversary, capability gap)

| Contest | Prize | Platform | Assessment |
|---|---|---|---|
| Limit Break AMM | $150,000 | Guardian Defender | No audit capability — skip unless acquired |
| Injective Peggy Bridge | $105,500 | Code4rena | EXPIRED (Mar 17) |
| Raindrops | $17,500 | Sherlock | Low prize + no capability — skip |

## Contingency Plan

- **Plan A:** LabLab $50K + Liquify $100K
- **Plan B:** DevNetwork $12.5K + Algora bounty farming (triggered if LabLab slips or Liquify EV goes negative)
- **Plan C:** Evaluate audit contest capability (triggered if A+B fail by June)

- ⚠️ Scout-2 agent needs fix or kill
- ⚠️ Guardian Defender / Sherlock not in source list — add for Cycle 11
- ✅ Structured pipeline file now produced (this cycle forward)
- ✅ Contingency plan documented
